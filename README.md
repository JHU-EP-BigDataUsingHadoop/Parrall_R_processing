# Parrall_R_processing
This is a paralleling processing using R.


R, by default is a single thread processing language. This package will help you to use R more efficiently by tunning it into a multiple thread processing. We test it with Monte Carlo Simulation. As you may download and test with different number of thread assign, you will be find out the maximum performance is not using all threads available. try different # of threads with small dataset to find the best # of thread for you machine before implement it in real project.
